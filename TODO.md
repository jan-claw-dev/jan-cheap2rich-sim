# TODO

- [ ] Analyze `Cheap2Rich.py` to extract the latent alignment dynamics (contrastive, frequency gating, SINDy/Lasso) and map them to differential equations.
- [ ] Draft `doc/architecture.md` describing how SciML solvers will feed narrative insights into the personal site.
- [ ] Prototype a simulation script (`scripts/initial_sim.py` or a Julia notebook) that integrates a simple ODE and outputs a narrative summary.
- [ ] Define metrics for the simulated stories (e.g., expected SSIM drift, warning level, recommended action).
- [ ] Plan how the new dashboard will push data/artifacts back into the `jan-personal-site` repo.
